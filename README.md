Match with co-founders based on your preferences. We are here to be the best platform out there.

We are live at <a href="https://cogit-founders.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>



I was inspired from YCombinator cofoudners platform and decided to build a better one.
Open-source projects are the best therefore to create the best out there I need your help to collaborate and achieve goals faster.

## Features
Build teams fast 

We use a flat hierarchy organizational structure with few or no levels of middle management.

You can vote! Just like on a board where you approve decisions, here you too can vote(for descisions or before accepting a new team member)! 

Everything transparent!

## Installation
```bash
npm i cofounders
```

### Made with Svelte Supabase and Tailwind :heart:	

## Supabase Schema
